## SECOND: Write SQL to Answer Stakeholder Questions

In this step, I have provided six queries, each in its own file under `sql/`


### Stakeholder Questions

1. **Top 5 Brands by Receipts Scanned for the Most Recent Month**  
   File: `sql/02_top5_brands.sql`  
2. **Ranking Comparison: Recent vs. Previous Month**  
   File: `sql/03_compare_months.sql`  
3. **Average Spend for ‘Accepted’ vs. ‘Rejected’ Receipts**  
   File: `sql/04_avg_spend_by_status.sql`  
4. **Total Items Purchased for ‘Accepted’ vs. ‘Rejected’ Receipts**  
   File: `sql/05_total_items_by_status.sql`  
5. **Brand with Highest Spend Among Users Created in the Last 6 Months**  
   File: `sql/06_top_brand_spend_new_users.sql`  
6. **Brand with Most Transactions Among Users Created in the Last 6 Months**  
   File: `sql/07_top_brand_txns_new_users.sql`
