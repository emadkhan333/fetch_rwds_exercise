# fetch_rwds_exercise

This repository contains my solution to the Fetch Rewards Analytics Engineer exercise. The work is organized into four folders—one per step—and each folder includes a README.md explaining that step, along with any SQL scripts, diagrams, or notebooks.

## Repository Structure
├── FIRST/
│ └── README.md : ER diagram & schema rationale
├── SECOND/
│ └── README.md : SQL queries for stakeholder questions
├── THIRD/
│ └── README.md : Data‐quality checks & exploratory notebook
├── FOURTH/
│ └── README.md : Stakeholder communication 


1. **Review the schema**  
   Open `FIRST/README.md` to see the proposed star schema and a humanized rationale.

2. **Run sample queries**  
   In `SECOND/README.md` you’ll find six SQL scripts. They live in `SECOND/sql/`.

3. **Validate data quality**  
   In `THIRD/README.md` contains a Jupyter notebook to perform EDA. This was built on Google Collab.

4. **See stakeholder write-up**  
   `FOURTH/README.md` contains the email message that summarizes findings, raises questions, and outlines next steps for a non-technical audience.
